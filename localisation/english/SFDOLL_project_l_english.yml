Who sent the signal to bring us here? These questions are still unanswered, but the investigation of the ruins has brought a lot of valuable scientific research materials."

sfdoll_search_zion_event.9:0 "Taking in girl from relic site"
sfdoll_search_zion_event.9_desc:0 "We took the girl found in the ruins to our Research Facility.\n\nWe found that in the girl's brain, there is a mind space similar to ours, which can send, receive and process data. \n\nThe language she uses is similar to the Earth language. In her consciousness, words like sister seemed to be repeating all the time. \n\nWe will continue to observe her."
